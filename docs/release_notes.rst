v1.7.1
======

Released on 2023-01-17.
This is a bugfix release.

Features
^^^^^^^^

* Add compatibility with Flask 2.2.X by using ``register_error_handler``
  instead of a plain WSGI wrapper. (:pr:`1008`).

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* ``/forgot-password/ask`` endpoint now handles ``smtplib.SMTPRecipientsRefused``
  error gracefully. (:issue:`817`).
* Store the chosen IPA server in the session for both the user client and the
  admin client. This prevents admin commands from running on a server and user
  commands running on another. (:issue:`1079`).
